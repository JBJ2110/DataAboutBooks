# Learning to think like a Power BI Boss

<p>This repository accompanies a blog series I am writing on my website: www.altentertraining.com.
The key to this blog series is that I am <em>learning </em>M and DAX. 
  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am on a quest and have been for a long time. I want to be good at M (the language used in the Power Query Editor) and DAX (the language used in the Power BI Desktop). It turns out that this is a non-trivial task. Not because these languages are a challenge to master (doh!), but because I have to figure out a way to tackle the <em>process </em>of learning these languages. I can read all the documentation and that is helpful. But I need to read and <em>then </em>try out the technique. I usually start with a problem that I want to solve, and do it the long, inelegant way. Then I realize that there <em>has </em>to a better way, and I reach out to my friends at #SML (the discussion group I run). And they always deliver with a better solution, which I then have to try to understand. </p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my blog, I am going to aim to write up the challenge, the inelegant solution (mine), and then the much more elegant solution(s) provided by my fellow #SMLers. This approach owes much to Ruth Curbal's "25 Days of DAX", in which she poses a question and people then provide a multiplicity of answers using a variety of techniques. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
There are plenty of incredible blogs written by experts who are already good at these languages, 
and I use these resources all the time. But I am writing from the perspective of someone 
who is trying to absorb the capabilities of both M and DAX. So if you are also someone who is 
trying to learn these languages, you might find my approach interesting. </p>
