# DataAboutBooks
Where I have stored all the data sources I have found that cover book-related data. The only data that I use is data that is publicly available.

<p>This repository accompanies a blog series I am writing on my website: www.altentertraining.com.
The key to this blog series is that I am <em>learning </em>M and DAX. 
There are plenty of incredible blogs written by experts who are already good at these languages, 
and I use these resources all the time. But I am writing from the perspective of someone 
who is trying to absorb the capabilities of both M and DAX. So if you are also someone who is 
trying to learn these languages, you might find my approach interesting. </p>
